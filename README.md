just another repository 
I am currently an assistant professor at SUNY Korea. My interests mainly focus on the area of control theory, nonlinear and variational analysis, nonsmooth analysis and generalized differentiation, optimization, and applications. Currently, I am working on optimal control of a perturbed sweeping process and finding some applications to the crowd motion model.
